# Namma_Yatri SQL & PowerBI
About Dataset
The objective behind analyzing this dataset was to provide insights to the management of the Namma yatri app. - The insights could be like the following:


How many searches take place and what is the conversion from searches to final ride by the customer?


Which areas and what duration has more demand?


How many users see the estimate fare and then decide not to proceed with booking the ride?


Based on the above, they could decide on micro based strategies of how to attract more users and convert them into opting for the ride.
